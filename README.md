# My DISMATH Portfolio

dismathportfolio-melvincabatuan created by Classroom for GitHub


## WEEK 1:

- This week I was introduced to a weird, but interesting subject: **Discrete Mathematics** (DISMATH).
- I've learned that it's full of hard topics and that I will fail this course if I will not study hard!
- I've learned that DISMATH deals ONLY with **mathematical truth**, and neither of the following: authoritative, legal, scientific, probable, nor philosophical truths.
- I also learned logical connectives and how to prove a statement by Truth table. 
- etc. (write as many learnings as you can...)


## WEEK 2:

- I learned logical equivalences which is quite similar to Algebraic laws.
- I also learned that I can simplify a logical statement using logical equivalences, as an alternative to the Truth table approach.
- I've learned a depressing truth, that 'SUPERMAN' does not really exist logically!!! 
- etc. (write as many learnings as you can...)
