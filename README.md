# My DISMATH Portfolio

## WEEK 1:

- This week I was introduced to a weird, but interesting subject: **Discrete Mathematics** (DISMATH).
- I've learned that it's full of hard topics, i.e. constructing proofs, algorithm pseudocodes, etc.; and that I might fail this course if I will not study hard!
- I've learned that DISMATH deals ONLY with **mathematical truth**, and neither of the following: authoritative, legal, scientific, probable, nor philosophical truths.
- I also learned logical connectives and how to prove a statement by Truth table. 
- I learned strange symbols, e.x., ¬ for Negation, ∧ for conjunction, ∨ for disjunction,⊕ for exclusive disjunction,  →
 for implication, and ↔ for biconditional.
- I find the implication most confusing, especially when the expression is no longer "if p, then q".
    - “p implies q”
    - “p only if q”
    - “if p, q”
    - “p is sufficient for q”
    - “a sufficient condition for q is p”
    - “q whenever p”
    - “q when p”
    - “a necessary condition for p is q”
    - “q is necessary for p”
    - “q follows from p”
- etc. (write as many learnings as you can...)


## WEEK 2:

- I learned logical equivalences which is quite similar to Algebraic laws.
- I also learned that I can simplify a logical statement using logical equivalences, as an alternative to the Truth table approach.
- I've learned a depressing truth, that 'SUPERMAN' does not really exist logically!!! 
- etc. (write as many learnings as you can...)
